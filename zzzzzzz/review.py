- Iterative
InsertionSort   O(n^2)
SelectionSort   O(n^2)
BubbleSort      O(n^2)


- Recursive
QuickSort   O(n log n) (not rally known as pivotssort)
MergeSort   O(n log n) (put together on way up)


Big O looks at worst case, when input gets really large

what about best case?
    - if input is small then iterative sort would be faster
    - when input is large or very large then recursive sorting is faster

what about small input?


Tradeoffs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nothing is perfect so decide what is needed for the problem
